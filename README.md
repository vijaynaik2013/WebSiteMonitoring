# WebSiteMonitoring
- This is a utility to monitor the website and send an email if the website goes out of service for some reason.
- Based on where the script is being run from, need to setup a scheduler(Windows)/Cron(Linux) for running health-check using the screen.
- Alternatively, code can be further improved by adding the timer within the script itself for scheduled runs.
- Please remember to set your Gmail account to "Less Secure" for email notifications to work fine using this script, please refer link below for details:
